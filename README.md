# Just a simple Malespín translator (word character interchange) :grinning:

The Malespín is a kind of Spanish-language slang which originated in the 19th
century in El Salvador and then spread to the rest of Central America. It is
currently vestigial, and survives only in a small number of words.

Tradition says that this slang was invented as a sort of key for the Salvadoran
military and political leader Francisco Malespín. General Malespin was elected
president in 1844 and deposed in 1845, after he led the country to war against
Guatemala.

Broadly speaking, it changes the folowing letters:

- a for e
- i for o
- b for t
- f for g
- p for m

and vice versa.
